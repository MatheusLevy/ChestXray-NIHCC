The dataset is comprised of X-Ray images of chests. The dataset is divided by patients. A patient can have more than one x-ray image.
The dataset folder contains:

* a data.csv with the info of the x-ray images
*  segmentation.csv that contains the segmentation annotation of the lungs for the chest x-rays.
